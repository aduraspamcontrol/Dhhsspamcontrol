Create a modern, professional one-page website for the DHHS GRANTS PROVIDER.

Requirements:

1. Header:

Title: “DHHS GRANTS PROVIDER"

Subtitle: “Department of Health and Human Services – Offering financial support to make life easier for everyone".  You can also add you own idea. Example It's a Department of Health and Human Services that offers to helps people from all backgrounds whether you’re working, a student, retired, young or old, deaf or hearing, widowed, or living with a disability. By offering grants and financial support to make life easier. 
Background: professional image of people receiving support/grants.



2. About Section:

Clear description: “The DHHS GRANTS PROVIDER helps people from all backgrounds — whether you’re working, a student, retired, young or old, deaf or hearing, widowed, or living with a disability. We provide grants and financial support to ease life’s burdens.”



3. Form Section:

At the center of the page, embed a Tally.so form inside a clean white card with rounded edges and soft shadows.

Responsive design so it looks perfect on mobile.

I will replace the embed link with my own Tally form (example: <iframe src="https://tally.so/embed/FORM_ID" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe>).



4. Testimonials Section:

Show at least 5 testimonials with names and profile photos. With Ratings 


5. News Section:

Add a professional news-style block with headlines like:

“Government announces new grant disbursement for 2025”

“Over 10,000 families supported by DHHS Grants last year”

“Expansion of financial aid programs to reach more communities”


Each news block should have an image and a short description.



6. WhatsApp Floating Widget:

At the bottom-right corner, add a floating WhatsApp button that stays visible.

Use this script template (I will replace the phone number with my own):

<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    var options = {
        whatsapp: "+234XXXXXXXXXX", // My phone number
        call_to_action: "Chat with us on WhatsApp", 
        position: "right", 
    };
    var proto = document.location.protocol, host = "getbutton.io", url = proto + "//static." + host;
    var s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.async = true; s.src = url + '/widget-send-button/js/init.js';
    s.onload = function () { WhWidgetSendButton.init(host, proto, options); };
    var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);
})();
</script>



7. Tawk.to Live Chat Widget:

Add the Tawk.to script at the bottom of the page (I will replace PROPERTY_ID with my real ID):

<!-- Start of Tawk.to Script -->
<script type="text/javascript">
var Tawk_API=Tawk_API||{}, Tawk_LoadStart=new Date();
(function(){
var s1=document.createElement("script"),s0=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
s1.async=true;
s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/PROPERTY_ID/DEFAULT';
s1.charset='UTF-8';
s1.setAttribute('crossorigin','*');
s0.parentNode.insertBefore(s1,s0);
})();
</script>
<!-- End of Tawk.to Script -->




Design Style:

Light blue background.

White card sections with rounded corners and drop shadows.

Professional, government-style typography.

Clean, modern, and mobile responsive.


The whole website must fit on one single page, scrolling smoothly from header → about → form → testimonials → news → footer.


Can you add a logo at the top 
Remove the previous logo and replace it with a program like logo at the top left corner 
Now replace the tally form with Google form 
Replace the top background picture with a official meetings photo 
Can you shift up the WhatsApp widget a little bit so that it won't affect the tawk.to widget
